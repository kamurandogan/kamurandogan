# Kamuran Doğan

Hello! I'm **Kamuran Doğan**. I'm an active mobile app developer, specializing in **Flutter** and **Dart** to build high-performance, user-friendly mobile applications. I always strive to use the best practices and the latest technologies in the software development process.

## 🛠️ My Skills

### Flutter & Dart
- **Widget-Based Development**: I design user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces using Flutter's extensive widget library.
- **State Management**: I implement clean and maintainable architectures in my apps using popular state management tools like `Provider`, `Bloc`, and `Riverpod`.
- **Stateful & Stateless Widgets**: I optimize performance by using Stateful and Stateless Widgets as needed in my applications.
- **Firebase Integration**: I integrate Firebase services such as real-time database, user authentication, and cloud storage into my applications.
- **Local Database & Cache Management**: By using tools like `Hive` and `SharedPreferences`, I store data locally to enhance the user experience.

### Other Technologies
- **RESTful API Integration**: I work with RESTful services in my applications, configuring APIs to meet user needs.
- **Git & GitHub**: I version control my projects with Git and share them on GitHub, contributing to the open-source community.
